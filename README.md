## Vacuous Sugar Quest Autosplittler
LiveSplit AutoSplitter for Vacuous Sugar Quest, a platformer game created by @walfie that can be found on (Itch)[https://walfie.itch.io/vacuous-sugar-quest].

## Features
This is the first iteration of the autosplitter, which should be sufficient enough to run Any% and 100% categories on 1.1.1 version of the game.
- The autosplitter starts when the first dialog ends, same as the in-game timer.
- The autosplitter splits automatically upon a powerup pickup. That means picking up Candy, Cookie, Cake and Sugar will trigger a split.
- The autosplitter also automatically ends the run when player reaches the summit.
